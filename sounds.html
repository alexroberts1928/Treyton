	<h1>The Sounds of Atlantis</h1>
	<p>The atmosphere is dark and very heavy. The slums, which occupy 75% of the city, is very noisy. There are cars constantly honking, tires screeching, sounds of gun fire, loud industrial machines filling the air with noise. This isn't a happy place. Our character lives with his mother alone in a one-bedroom apartment. He looks out for his mother and protects her especially after his father was killed when he was young. Although being portrayed as the quiet, tough guy, he does have 5 close friends he grew up with in which he is comfortable opening up around. The weather conditions are almost constant every day. Dark cloudy skies, rain, and thunderstorms, the city never sees sun.</p>
