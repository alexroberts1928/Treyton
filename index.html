	<h1>Biography of Treyton</h1>
	<p>His name is Treyten, but the other guys in the neighborhood call him El Diablo. Trey has a lean, slightly muscular, 6‚Äù0 build. He bares scars on his body and one on his face, all from the past that shadows him wherever he goes. He upholds a lazy posture and a serious mug. He dresses nice but in a carefree manner.</p>
